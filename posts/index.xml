      <description>TR; DR: Razer Viper Ultimate is currently not configurable on Linux but can be used.
I bought Razer Viper Ultimate. It is the first time I bought an expensive mouse, but I really liked it!
First impressions I Felt the body was light and a very fast connection for a wireless mouse.
And the feel of the click bottom and sensor is very good.
But I feel the mouse wheel is heavy.</description>
